# Personal Movie Recommendations

## Project Overview

Welcome to my **Personal Movie Recommendations**, a personal movie review webpage called **Almantas K. Critiq**. 
This site showcases my top movie recommendations across various genres. Each recommendation comes with a brief synopsis, rating out of 10, and a link for further details.
This is my **first semester project**.

**Note**: Please be aware that this project is **not responsive**.

## Features

- A visually appealing design using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**;
- Recommendations organized by genre (Sci-Fi, Drama, Romance, etc.);
- Interactive buttons to navigate between genres;
- Includes a **back-to-top** button for better navigation;
- **Easter Egg**: Hidden feature where pressing the Tab key reveals a secret "movie #0" link at the top of the navigation. 
Pressing this link scrolls down to reveal another "movie #0" link at the bottom, showcasing a special movie recommendation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the webpage structure;
- **CSS3**: For styling and design (includes custom stylesheets for the cubes and scrollbar);
- **JavaScript**: For minor functionality, such as back-to-top button and email sending features;
- **Bootstrap 5**: For styling;
- **Font Awesome**: For icons and visual enhancements;
- **jQuery**: For styling and basic DOM manipulation;
- **EmailJS**: For sending emails directly from the webpage.
